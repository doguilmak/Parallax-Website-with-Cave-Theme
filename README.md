In this project, a parallax web page was created with the cave picture downloaded from the www.freepik.com internet address. The picture uploaded by the **upklyak** user to the freepic page and downloaded by us is divided into 5 different parts with Adobe XD to create a bright effect. The original size is 6709x2684 and 2.11 MB, the image has been reduced by 50% to make site faster. The post-conversion size of the theme is 3355x1342.
